            <h1 style="color:#006600 ">Who is Enzo?</h1>
            <p>Hi, I am Enzo. I was born and raised in New York. More specifically I was raised in a middle class home in Westchester County, the "city suburbs." I am of Cuban, British, and Italian descent and am one of five children. I am fluent in two languages: English and Spanish.</p>
            <p>After graduating from Ossining High School in 2017, I knew that I wanted a geographical change. Thus, I took my talents to South Beach...rather, North Carolina and started attending school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Science (Data Analytics concentration) and a second major in Public Policy (Innovation/Tech policy concentration), as well as a minor in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. I will graduate in May 2021. I hope to pursue a career in the FinTech realm, but am open to opportunities in consulting, software engineering, and data science.</p> 
            <p>I consider myself adaptable, a quick learner, and a diligent worker. I am a natural leader and problem solver, and have greatly improved my programming skills over the past few years. My drive for success is a testament to my diverse ethnic and work background.</p> 
            <p>Outside of school and work, I am an avid investor in stocks and cryptocurrencies, enjoy listening to podcasts and music, and hanging out with friends and family. I stay active by playing tennis, golf, and swimming. I recently started writing a blog about topics that I am interested in. Check it out by clicking on the Blog icon to the right. </p>
            <p>Here is a link to my resume, which shows my experiences and skills in more detail: <a href=""pdf_server.php?file=LorenzoMuranelliResume.pdf">Resume</a></p>
