        <p style="color:black; font-size: 15x">Sunday, December 20, 2020</p>
        <p> Why did I start writing a blog? I’ve never written any sort of journal or diary about my life. But the other day I listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCl9A9NlRw">Joe Rogan’s podcast with Matthew McConaughey</a> on my drive back from Washington, D.C., and he talked about how since the time he was a youngster, he would write things down and when he grew older, he was able to reflect on his thoughts as a teenager and young adult. This helped him grow as a person and deal with the ups and downs of life. As a result, he claims he has lived a happier life. This paired with the idea that one day, I will pass away, and all of my thoughts will be forgotten. Unless you have revolutionized the world in some way, the odds that your name is brought up 100 years down the road are slim. Thus, you might as well take the opportunity to get your thoughts out to the world, and what better way to do it than a blog? Now I will admit, I am a bit late to the game, but better late than never. I recommend you do the same—just do it! </p> 
        <p> Now that that’s out of the way, I woke up to Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1340581313406001153">tweeting memes </a>about Bitcoin and his infamous meme cryptocurrency, Dogecoin. All jokes aside, this could be huge for Bitcoin. Michael Taylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy who used his own company’s balance sheet to stockpile a lot of Bitcoin, seriously a lot, replied to Elon and encouraged him to do the same. If Elon hops on the Bitcoin train, which many think he will, the price could skyrocket and more institutional investors could hop in and do the same. Tesla will soon be added to the S&P 500, and Tesla like Bitcoin, has had its fair share of skeptics and shorts since its inception. People have doubted Elon Musk time and time again, but Tesla shares continue to skyrocket and the company’s mantra for a cleaner, less gas dependent world has spread throughout the auto industry to companies like Fisker, Workhorse, Toyota, Ford, GMC, etc. </p>
        <p> One individual who has not doubted Elon Musk or Tesla is Cathie Wood. Cathie Wood is the CEO of <a href="https://ark-invest.com">ARKInvest</a>, a popular investment firm that has gained recent notoriety for its impressive YTD performance. ARK ETF’s have performed better than nearly all other ETF’s and are centered around disruptive innovation (ARKK), next generation internet (ARKW), robotics and AI (ARKQ), financial technology (ARKF), and genomics and biotechnology (ARKG), as well as 3D printing (PRNT). Cathie Wood has upended the traditional male dominated investment firm CEO stereotype and I don’t see her slowing down anytime soon. She bet big on Tesla’s meteoric rise, as well as Roku, Square and Paypal, and many others. Cathie Wood predicts that Bitcoin and Ethereum will also continue to rise <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-12-18/ark-s-cathie-wood-remains-extremely-bullish-on-bitcoin-video">(she is "extremely bullish")</a>. She recently said that Bitcoin could potentially see a $400k price target as more institutions invest. ARK is also invested in Greyscale Trust, an ETF for cryptocurrencies. Long story short, Cathie Wood is a beast and I'd listen to what she has to say. </p>
        <p> Today is also Sunday, which means that football is on. I’m not going to highlight every game but the Pats/Dolphins will be interesting. We’re getting a better idea of how the playoff standings are shaping up, and now I’m just waiting on the Bills to clinch that top AFC East spot. If you are bored of fantasy or have already lost your league, if your state has not legalized sports betting yet, or if your illegal bookie has not been paying you out, try betting on a multi-team spread using the <a href="https://playbarstool.com">PlayBarstool</a> app. It costs nothing on your end and if you get them all right, you have the chance of splitting a pot of anywhere from $20k-$50k. I will admit, it is very hard. </p>

        <p>Bitcoin hit 24k this morning, another major milestone in the crypto’s historic run. Keep an eye out on alt coins as well such as Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, and Chainlink. One of the main drawbacks of Bitcoin right now is that it can only be used as a store of value (like Gold), but can not be used for everyday transactions between people in the way that fiat currency is used to buy and sell products and services. However, the $ continues to be inflated and if anyone is familiar with basic economics, supply and demand teaches us that the more of something that there is, the less value that it holds (money printer go Brrrr). Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million and many are lost to the abyss, making it more scarce than the U.S. dollar. Many consider Bitcoin to be the digital equivalent to gold. However, everyone is waiting for federal regulations for crypto wallets that could impact how cryptcurrencies are bought, sold, mined, stored, etc. This could come in the form of new taxes. As major institutions continue to adopt cryptocurrencies, expect federal regulations to follow. If you would like to hop on the Bitcoin wave, I would suggest using the app, Coinbase. However, I am not a financial advisor so proceed at your own risk.</p> 
        <p>Yesterday, I found a cool website that allows you to compare different measurements, objects, and time (place and space) such as the different depths that ocean creatures live at in meters, the scale of different stars and planets, and a Bill Gates net worth tool that lets you essentially buy as many yachts, mansions, and Apache helicopters that you want: check it out here at <a href="https://neal.fun">neal.fun</a>. I’d also recommend checking out Joe Rogan’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44">Naval Ravikant podcast</a> where they discuss life, happiness, and success—it is quite eye opening. I’ve listened to it about 3 times and learn something new everytime. If you like that, follow Naval on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/naval?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@naval</a> and look at the pinned thread post for inspiration ("How to Get Rich (without getting lucky)").</p>
        <p>On a less optimistic note, my school, UNC Chapel Hill, was recently involved in a major federal drug trafficking ring where the feds busted numerous individuals in different fraternities for no less than a collective 1.5 million dollars of marijuana, cocaine, and narcotics—quite the seize. It hasn’t been a great year for UNC’s brand but hopefully our football and basketball team can make up for it, right? Our basketball team is currently ranked 22nd and plays Kentucky today at 2pm. The moneyline is UNC: -154 and UK: +130. The spread is UNC: -2.5 and UK: +2.5. Our odds to win the Natty are +2300—I love how much Vegas underestimates us.</p>
