        <p style="color:black; font-size: 15x">Tuesday, December 22, 2020</p>
        <p> As I mentioned at the end of my last blog post, everyone in the U.S. (depending on how your taxes are filed) will receive $600 from the $900 billion stimulus “relief” package. The stimulus bill itself is over 5,000 pages long and it would take me a long time to summarize the whole thing (nor do I even think I could). Here is a <a href="https://twitter.com/CPAPlanner/status/1341111472269746180">Twitter thread </a>that does a good job of summarizing some of the key points. But congress is required to vote on the bill in just a matter of hours. This suggests that not a single representative will be able to realistically read the entire bill (or constituent) and provide feedback until after the vote has passed (unless you took a lot of Adderall). I noticed that in the bill, there are numerous tax breaks for the wealthy (which is to be expected) such as owning a horse, and millions of dollars are allocated to foreign countries such as Venezuela, Cambodia, etc. But U.S. citizens get a measly $600. Seems fair. I could go on and on about how erroneous the bill is and how incompetent our "leaders" are, but I rest my case. The oligopoly lives on. </p>
		<p>In other news, Apple is planning to produce electric vehicles with a new battery design in 2024. Now that a big tech company is entering the EV space, I could see companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook doing the same and competing directly with Tesla. </p>       
        <p>The cryptocurrency firm Ripple is going to be sued by the SEC for selling its XRP currency. The SEC claims that the company violated investor-protection laws by selling unregistered securities when it sold XRP. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse claimed that XRP, like Bitcoin, should be classified as a cryptocurrency and shouldn’t require an investment contract. Ripple also claimed that Bitcoin is controlled by the Chinese. XRP has a market cap of more than $20 billion and is one of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrencies. It is third to Bitcoin and Ethereum in trading volume, according to <a href="https://www.bybit.com">bybit</a>. I don’t know enough about the XRP case to take sides here, but this is obviously not a great sign for crypto when it comes to government intervention—crypto’s core tenant is decentralization. Perhaps Ripple was doing some shady stuff behind the scenes, but I am interested to see how this plays out. And what do we do with the claim that Bitcoin is controlled by the Chinese? Is that just a desperate accusation or is there something deeper? I don’t know.

        <p>Since I like to invest in stocks and crypto, I figured I’d provide a great investing resource. <a href="https://finviz.com">Finviz.com</a> is a site that lets you see insider trades for any company ranging from CEOs and CFOs, to 10% owners and so on. Finviz is updated daily and is an extremely helpful resource. Obviously, you have to do your own due diligence, but it is a useful tool. Additionally, I like to use the <a href="https://www.fidelity.com">Fidelity</a> brokerage platform for long-term investing in a normal brokerage account and Roth IRA, and WeBull for short-term investments. <a href=" https://act.webull.com/pt/7qmI9AMOy8Rp/cm1/inviteUs/">WeBull</a> is a beginner friendly investing platform that lets users see real-time technical analysis such as resistance lines, comments from other users, performance indicators, and other relevant information. If you sign up, you get two free stocks and if you refer two friends you get 10 free stocks. </p>
        <h4 style="color:black;font-size:18px">Third post: Tame Impala and rebuilding</h4> <IMG SRC="https://media.giphy.com/media/4qjP6rIloYJEs/giphy.gif">
        <p style="color:black; font-size: 15x">Monday, December 21, 2020</p>
        <p> Let’s talk about music. Not just any kind of music though. I want to talk about a specific Australian music artist/band—Tame Impala. It seems as though whenever I get sick of repeatedly listening to the same 200 song playlist and need a change of pace, I end up on a Tame Impala bender. I don’t know if I am the only one, but I think that Tame Impala takes first place on my music artist’s list right now. I consider their music to be psychedelic rock/pop—they’re like a modern day Pink Floyd (who I also happen to like). I don’t know of anyone getting hype to Tame Impala for a pregame or at the gym, but they’re great for casual listening. I also still don’t know if Tame Impala is one man (Kevin Parker) or multiple, but who cares? I recommend you <a href="https://official.tameimpala.com"> check them out </a>if you haven’t already. </p> 
        <p> Next, I want to talk about a website that I came across that lets you essentially track all of your spending. Now I know that there are many applications or websites that already do this, but I think <a href="https://statusmoney.com">statusmoney.com</a> got it right. Just make a list of all of your accounts, whether it be credit cards, savings or checking accounts, or brokerages. Enter the information after you sign up and voila, a comprehensive breakdown of all of your spending. Now that I am technically an “adult,” I find a website like this to be extremely helpful. </p>
        <p> There’s an NFL game on tonight, the Steelers/Bengals. The Steelers already clinched their division and the Bengals suck, but it’s better than nothing I suppose. Also, the Jets finally won a game! Poor Jets fans (I know many). I don’t feel bad for Jets fans though, I am a Mets fan (MLB) and a Rangers fan (NHL), two franchises that have utterly disappointed in recent years. Yeah, we had a run a few years ago, but then we fell off a cliff. Rebuild after rebuild, how many rebuilds can a team undergo? However, I am looking forward to seeing what the Mets new owner Steve Cohen can accomplish. He runs a hedge fund and is an avid Mets fan, so hopefully there’s a bright future ahead. </p>
        <p> As a final side note, the government stimulus is a whopping $600 per person. Quite a shame that our politicians couldn’t care less about us, their constituents, the people they are supposed to care about, the people that elected them to their positions. I’d rather receive $100 worth of satoshis and a case of beer. But whatever, maybe we’re in a rebuilding phase.  </p>
        <h2 style="color:black;font-size:18px">Second post: Blogging, Elon Musk, and Cathie Wood</h2> <IMG SRC="https://media.giphy.com/media/2Y8Iq3xe121Ba3hUAM/giphy.gif">
        <p style="color:black; font-size: 15x">Sunday, December 20, 2020</p>
        <p> Why did I start writing a blog? I’ve never written any sort of journal or diary about my life. But the other day I listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCl9A9NlRw">Joe Rogan’s podcast with Matthew McConaughey</a> on my drive back from Washington, D.C., and he talked about how since the time he was a youngster, he would write things down and when he grew older, he was able to reflect on his thoughts. This helped McConaughey grow as a person and deal with the ups and downs of life. As a result, he claims he has lived a happier life. I then paired McConaughey's advice with the idea that one day, I will pass away, and all of my thoughts will be forgotten. Unless you have revolutionized the world in some way like Albert Einstein or Nikola Tesla, the odds that your name is brought up 100 years down the road are slim. Thus, you might as well take the opportunity to get your thoughts out to the world, and what better way to do it than a blog? Now I will admit, I am a bit late to the game, but better late than never. I recommend you do the same—just do it! </p> 
        <p> Now that that’s out of the way, I woke up to Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1340581313406001153">tweeting memes </a>about Bitcoin and his infamous meme cryptocurrency, Dogecoin. All jokes aside, this could be huge for Bitcoin. Michael Taylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy who used his own company’s balance sheet to stockpile a lot of Bitcoin, seriously a lot, replied to Elon and encouraged him to do the same. If Elon hops on the Bitcoin train, which many think he will, the price could skyrocket and more institutional investors could hop in and do the same. Tesla will soon be added to the S&P 500, and Tesla like Bitcoin, has had its fair share of skeptics and shorts since its inception. People have doubted Elon Musk time and time again, but Tesla shares continue to surge and the company’s mantra for a cleaner, less gas dependent world has spread throughout the auto industry to companies like Fisker, Workhorse, Toyota, Ford, GMC, etc. </p>
        <p> One individual who has not doubted Elon Musk or Tesla is Cathie Wood. Cathie Wood is the CEO of <a href="https://ark-invest.com">ARKInvest</a>, a popular investment firm that has gained recent notoriety for its impressive YTD performance. ARK ETFs have performed better than nearly all other ETFs and are centered around disruptive innovation (ARKK), next generation internet (ARKW), robotics and AI (ARKQ), financial technology (ARKF), and genomics and biotechnology (ARKG), as well as 3D printing (PRNT). Cathie Wood has upended the traditional male dominated investment firm CEO stereotype and I don’t see her slowing down anytime soon. She bet big on Tesla’s meteoric rise, as well as Roku, Square and Paypal, and many others. Cathie Wood predicts that Bitcoin and Ethereum will also continue to rise <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-12-18/ark-s-cathie-wood-remains-extremely-bullish-on-bitcoin-video">(she is "extremely bullish")</a>. She recently said that Bitcoin could potentially see a $400k price target as more institutions invest. ARK is also invested in Grayscale Trust, an ETF for cryptocurrencies. Long story short, Cathie Wood is a beast and I'd listen to what she has to say. </p>
        <p> Today is also Sunday, which means that football is on. I’m not going to highlight every game but the Pats/Dolphins will be interesting. We’re getting a better idea of how the playoffs will shape up, and I'm glad the Bills clinched that top AFC East spot. They are my SuperBowl favorites. We'll see how the Giants perform later tonight against the Cleveland Browns. If you are bored of fantasy or have already lost your league, if your state has not legalized sports betting yet, or if your illegal bookie has not been paying you out, try betting on a multi-team spread using the <a href="https://playbarstool.com">PlayBarstool</a> app. It costs nothing on your end and if you get them all right, you have the chance of splitting a pot of anywhere from $20k-$50k. I will admit, it is pretty hard to win. </p>

        <p style="color:black; font-size: 15x">Saturday, December 19, 2020</p>
        <p>Bitcoin hit 24k this morning, another major milestone in the crypto’s historic run. Keep an eye out on alt coins as well such as Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, and Chainlink. One of the main drawbacks of Bitcoin right now is that it can only be used as a store of value (like Gold), but can not be used for everyday transactions between people in the way that fiat currency is used to buy and sell products and services. However, the $ continues to be inflated and if anyone is familiar with basic economics, supply and demand teaches us that the more of something that there is, the less value that it holds (money printer go Brrrr). Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million and many are lost to the abyss, making it more scarce than the U.S. dollar. Many consider Bitcoin to be the digital equivalent to gold. However, everyone is waiting for federal regulations for crypto wallets that could impact how cryptcurrencies are bought, sold, mined, stored, etc. This could come in the form of new taxes. As major institutions continue to adopt cryptocurrencies, expect federal regulations to follow. If you would like to hop on the Bitcoin wave, I would suggest using the app <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>. However, I am not a financial advisor so proceed at your own risk.</p> 
        <p>Yesterday, I found a cool website that allows you to compare different measurements, objects, and time (place and space) such as the different depths that ocean creatures live at in meters, the scale of different stars and planets, and a Bill Gates net worth tool that lets you essentially buy as many yachts, mansions, and Apache helicopters that you want: check it out here at <a href="https://neal.fun">neal.fun</a>. I’d also recommend checking out Joe Rogan’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44">Naval Ravikant podcast</a> where they discuss life, happiness, and success—it is quite eye opening. I’ve listened to it about 3 times and learn something new everytime. If you like that, follow Naval on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/naval?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@naval</a> and look at the pinned thread post for inspiration ("How to Get Rich (without getting lucky)").</p>
        <p>On a less optimistic note, my school, UNC Chapel Hill, was recently involved in a major federal drug trafficking ring where the feds busted numerous individuals in different fraternities for no less than a collective 1.5 million dollars of marijuana, cocaine, and narcotics—quite the seize. It hasn’t been a great year for UNC’s brand but hopefully our football and basketball teams can make up for it, right? Our basketball team is currently ranked 22nd and plays Kentucky today at 2pm. The moneyline is UNC: -154 and UK: +130. The spread is UNC: -2.5 and UK: +2.5. Our odds to win the Natty are +2300—I love how much Vegas underestimates us.</p>
